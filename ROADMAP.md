# Sheet Note Labels - Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision
Create an iOS app that captures photos of printed sheet music and overlays clear alphabetic note names (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) directly below each notehead, helping musicians easily identify pitches while preserving the original musical notation for rhythm and timing information.

## 📱 Current Status (v1.0 - Demo)

### ✅ **Completed Features**
- **SwiftUI Interface**: Clean, modern UI with navigation flow
- **Camera Integration**: Photo capture and library selection via PhotosPicker
- **Demo Mode**: Bundled PDF samples for testing and demonstration
- **Basic OMR Pipeline**: Vision framework integration for note detection
- **Visual Overlay System**: Red note letters with white outlines on original sheet music
- **Export Functionality**: PDF export and image sharing capabilities
- **Pitch Mapping Logic**: Treble and bass clef support with comprehensive unit tests
- **Mock Note Detection**: 5 sample notes for consistent demo experience

### 🔧 **Current Limitations**
- **Alignment Issue**: Note labels appear in bottom strip instead of below actual noteheads
- **Mock-Only Detection**: Uses fixed positions rather than real computer vision
- **Single Staff**: Only processes first detected staff system
- **Basic Notation**: Works with simple quarter notes only
- **No Accidentals**: Sharp/flat detection not implemented

## 🚀 **Next Phase - Production Ready (v2.0)**

### 🔥 **Critical Fixes (High Priority)**
1. **Fix Note Alignment** - Position labels directly below detected noteheads
2. **Real Staff Detection** - Replace mock staff with Hough transform line detection
3. **Actual Notehead Detection** - Replace mock notes with Vision-based detection
4. **Multi-Staff Support** - Handle multiple staff systems per image
5. **Console Debugging** - Fix Xcode debug output for development

### 🎵 **Core Music Features (Medium Priority)**
6. **Clef Detection** - Automatic treble/bass clef recognition
7. **Key Signature Support** - Handle sharps, flats, and key signatures
8. **Accidental Detection** - Sharp, flat, and natural symbols
9. **Note Type Recognition** - Quarter, half, whole, eighth notes
10. **Ledger Lines** - Extended range notes above/below staff

### ⚙️ **User Experience (Medium Priority)**
11. **Settings Screen** - Clef selection, label size, export options
12. **Batch Processing** - Multiple images at once
13. **Real-time Camera** - Live preview with note detection
14. **Accessibility** - VoiceOver, larger labels, high contrast mode
15. **Tutorial/Onboarding** - Guide users through first use

### 🧠 **Advanced Features (Low Priority)**
16. **Core ML Integration** - Machine learning model for improved accuracy  
17. **Time Signature Detection** - Recognize 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, etc.
18. **Chord Recognition** - Multiple simultaneous notes
19. **Handwritten Music** - Support for hand-drawn notation
20. **Audio Playback** - Play detected notes for verification

## 🎯 **Target Milestones**

### **v1.1 - Alignment Fix (Next Sprint)**
- Fix critical note positioning issue
- Improve visual feedback and debugging
- Polish demo experience

### **v1.5 - Real Detection (Month 1)**
- Implement actual staff line detection
- Real notehead detection using Vision
- Multi-staff basic support

### **v2.0 - Production Release (Month 2-3)**
- Settings and user customization
- Clef and key signature support
- Polished UI/UX with onboarding
- App Store ready

### **v3.0 - Advanced Features (Month 4-6)**
- Core ML integration
- Advanced music theory features
- Real-time camera processing
- Premium features

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture Goals**

### **Current Architecture**
```
├── App/ (SwiftUI views and navigation)
├── OMR/ (Computer vision and analysis)
├── Rendering/ (Visual overlay and export)
└── Tests/ (Unit tests for core logic)
```

### **Future Architecture Improvements**
- **Modular OMR Engine**: Plugin system for different detection algorithms
- **Core ML Pipeline**: Trainable models for improved accuracy
- **Caching System**: Processed results for faster re-analysis
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional backup and sharing across devices
- **Analytics**: Usage metrics and accuracy tracking (privacy-focused)

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Technical Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: >90% note detection accuracy on clean printed music
- **Performance**: <2 second analysis time on modern iPhones
- **Reliability**: <5% crash rate in production
- **Coverage**: Support for 95% of common musical notation

### **User Metrics**  
- **Adoption**: Positive user feedback and app store ratings
- **Engagement**: Users process multiple images per session
- **Retention**: Users return to app within 7 days
- **Growth**: Word-of-mouth recommendations from musicians

## 🎼 **Use Cases & Personas**

### **Primary Users**
- **Music Students**: Learning to read sheet music and identify notes quickly
- **Adult Learners**: Returning to music after years, need note identification help
- **Music Teachers**: Demonstrating note names and positions to students
- **Casual Musicians**: Playing by ear but want to understand written music

### **Key Use Cases**
1. **Practice Session**: Student photographs exercise, gets instant note identification
2. **Lesson Prep**: Teacher prepares materials with labeled examples
3. **Self-Study**: Adult learner works through method books with note help
4. **Performance**: Musician quickly identifies unfamiliar passages

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **Current Process**
1. **Feature Development**: Local Xcode development with real device testing
2. **Version Control**: Git with feature branches and pull requests  
3. **Testing**: Unit tests for core logic, manual UI testing
4. **Documentation**: Inline comments, README updates
5. **Release**: Manual deployment and GitHub releases

### **Future Improvements**
