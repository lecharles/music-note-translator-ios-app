# Project brief: SheetNoteLabels (iOS)
We label printed sheet music with alphabetic note names under each note, on-device only.
User flow: capture → analyze → preview/export. Keep OMR modular (protocol) with a heuristic MVP and a future Core ML path.
Non-goals: audio-to-score, handwriting OCR, cloud inference.
Accessibility: large labels toggle; high-contrast export.
